					BROOKLYN, NY: The causes of domestic violence have long been unknown. Our analysis of recent state numbers only raises further questions.
					</p>

					<p>
					Researchers from the United Kingdom have been members of the scientific community that find unemployment is a significant driver of intimate partner violence. Assuming two genders, <a href=url"https://ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/unemployment-and-domestic-violence-theory-and-evidence">their</a> <a href=url"https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/unemployment_substantially_increases/">studies</a> show that men who lose their jobs are more like to commit violence and women in the same position are more likely to suffer from it. Our analysis does not show their strong correlation.
					</p>

					<p>
					Recent information from the New York State Departments of Labor and Justice show that might not be the case here in the Empire State. Their preliminary numbers for 2022 did not include the gender of the unemployed, nor did it provide information about job loss. We compared correlations when the victim was a man, woman, or other member of the household and found only marginal differences. In past years, the unemployment rate has varied between genders by as much as 20%. With that the number of homosexual households, we are not able to make adequate conclusions about the attacker based on the gender of the victim.
					</p>

					<p>
					One <a href-"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/961291579703477493/pdf/Intimate-Partner-Violence-The-Influence-of-Job-Opportunities-for-Men-and-Women.pdf"> World Bank Report </a> declared that a higher correlation between violence and the gender of the unemployed is found in developing countries, linking higher rates with relative difficulties accessing divorce. New York's divorce rate is <a href=”https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/divorce-rate-by-state”> relatively low</a> for the United States, 2.2%, putting it slightly higher than the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/divorce/divorce-statistics/">global average</a> of 1.8% of marriages ending in divorce per year.
					</p>

					<p>
					Intimate partner violence information is also notoriously unreliable, as reporting rates can vary on cultures, feelings of security, economic factors, access to impartial authorities, and other factors. The Department of Justice data relies on criminal reports.
					</p>
